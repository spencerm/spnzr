# Theme\Assets

This class (it's actually a facade) provides tools to work with assets.

## Theme\Assets::getThemeUri()

Return the public URI of the theme root directory.
This is useful since `get_template_directory_uri()` will return the URI to the `theme/` directory inside your theme (instead of the root directory) since this is where the theme's `style.css` file is.

## Theme\Assets::enqueueStyle( $handle, $src, $dependencies = [], $media = 'all' )

Enqueue a style like `wp_enqueue_style()` does but provide an automatic version number derived from the file's modified time.
Essentially provide a built-in, automatic and fool-proof cache breaker for the enqueued style.

## Theme\Assets::enqueueScript( $handle, $src, $dependencies = [], $in_footer = false )

Enqueue a script like `wp_enqueue_script()` does but provide an automatic version number derived from the file's modified time.
Essentially provide a built-in, automatic and fool-proof cache breaker for the enqueued script.

## Theme\Assets::addFavicon()

Output a &lt;link /&gt; tag for the site favicon pointing to `dist/images/favicon.ico` which is generated by default from `resources/images/favicon.ico`.
Will not output anything if you have already added a favicon through WordPress' Customizer so it does not override it.
